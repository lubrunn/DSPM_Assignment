# Exercise 1
### Exercise 1.1
Perform a first GET request, that searches for event venues in Germany (countryCode = "DE"). Extract
the content from the response object and inspect the resulting list. Describe what you can see.

```{r 1}

resp_ven <- GET(glue("https://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v2/venues?apikey={key}&locale=*&countryCode=DE"))
con_ven <- fromJSON(content(resp_ven, as = "text"))
```
The resulting list contains three elements. The first contains the information of interest such as as the name and the location of the venues. The second element is the _links object and contains links to data sets. The last element is the page object. It contains information about the current page in the data source.
